                   <p class="para">I have worked on different projects with different skills I have coverd so far. I continue exploring new technologies and produce piece of work based on technology I explore. I will always be working on different projects to improve my knowledge, experience and techniques. I publish all of my projects on Github, I'm also looking forward to contribute on other people's projects and open source.</p>

                   <p class="para">I put much focus on front end stuffs, I find front end technologies more interesting and amazing to work with. All the work I have done so far covers concepts of HTML/HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS and Ajax. Basically those are the skills I'm aware of right now but it's not the end of the journey, I'm going to explore important and powerful skills along the way.</p>

                   <p class="para">Sass, Less, ReactJS and Angular2, these are technologies I haven't touched yet but I really desire to master them and I will because I feel like I should have a strong understanding of these technologies to be a front end expert. My goal is to be someone who is going to be remembered for what I have done and I'm pretty sure that goal will be achieved because I'm a life long learner.</p>

                   <p class="para">I started studying computer programming (C language) before dive deep into web development. In 2016 I discovered Lynda.com I took a deep survey and I found Front End Web Development so entertaining and pleasure to learn, so I studied most lessons in Lynda.com until I came to reveal another code school treehouse. I love treehouse it has the best tutors. I also joined there and picked some lessons.</p>
                   
                   <p class="para">Here my short life story, I started by joining medical school in Kampala, Uganda right after finishing my secondary school education. During my time there I figured that wasn't for me so I quit and join engineering school where i was awarded certificate of engineering principles.</p>
                  
                   <p class="para">Ever since I was little boy I loved to surf around the internet, I used to spend most of time in good looking websites than normal and ugly websites. All I wanted was great user experience. I had no idea technology was built for me until I enrolled in Kampala International University (Medical School) in Uganda. I was studying Medical laboratory technology but it was more based on human science.</p>
